# mice-on-plates
## A recipe app that makes following directions as easy as possible.

Wait, why is it called "Mice on Plates"? Because it sounds like *mise en place*, which is preparing and pre-measuring your ingredients in bowls, and setting out all your equipment ahead of time. I aim to make that preparation easier with this app.

### What this app will include:
- Responsive design on phone, tablet, and desktop
- List of equipment needed (including number of bowls)
- Ingredients, broken down into groups that can be measured out together (just because we're *mise en place*-ing doesn't mean we have to use a bowl for every individual ingredient)
- Checkboxes to keep track of your ingredients and steps as you go
- Built-in timers for the timed steps
- Quick note section to write down any modifications made.
